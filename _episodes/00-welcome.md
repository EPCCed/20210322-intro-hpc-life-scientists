## Course structure and method

Some parts of this course are taught following [The Carpentries
methodology](https://carpentries.org). Typically, this follows the
method of the instructor demonstrating and the attendees following 
along with the instructor.

You should feel free to ask questions of the instructors whenever you
like. The instructor will also provide opportunities to pause and
ask questions.

We will also make use of a shared collaborative document - the *etherpad*. You
will find a link to this collaborative document on the course page. We will
use it for a number of different purposes, for example, it may be used during
exercises and instructors and helpers may put useful information or links in
the etherpad that help or expand on the material being taught. If you have
useful information to share with the class then please do add it to the
etherpad. At the end of the course, we take a copy of the information in the
etherpad, remove any personally-identifiable information and post this on the
course archive page so you should always be able to come back and find any
information you found useful.

## Feedback

Feedback is integral to how we approach training both during and after
the course. In particular, we use feedback during the course to ensure
we tailor the pace and content appropriately for the attendees and
feedback after the course to help us improve our training for the
future.

At the end of each day we will also run a quick feedback activity to
gauge how the course is matching onto attendees requirements. 

Finally, you will be provided with the opportunity to provide feedback on the
course after it has finished. We welcome all this feedback, both good and bad,
as this information in key to allow us to continually improve the training we
offer.
