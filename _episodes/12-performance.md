In general, there are two advantages to running applications in parallel: 
(1) applications will run more quickly and we can get our solutions faster, 
and (2) we can solve larger, more complex problems.

In an ideal world, if we increase the number of cores we are using by a 
factor of 10, we should be able to either get the solution to our current 
problem 10 times faster, or to run a system 10 times bigger in the same 
amount of time as now.

Unfortunately, this is often not the case...

### How to measure parallel performance?

Measuring parallel performance can help us to understand:

- whether our application is making the most of the cores assigned to it
- the factors that can improve or hinder performance
- how best to use the application and available HPC resources

But, how do we quantify performance when running in parallel? Consider 
a system with an execution time of *T* - this time will depend on the 
size/complexity *N* of the system and the number of processors/cores *P* being 
used to run this system. One way to measure performance could be to consider 
the speedup of the system compared with a run on a single processor:

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S(N,P) = \frac{T(N,1)}{T(N,P)}.)

Ideally, the speedup increases in a linear fashion, meaning that as you double 
the number of processors used, your speedup will also double. However, this is 
rarely the case.

Another metric to consider is the parallel efficiency *E*(*N*, *P*). This is 
a measure of how the speedup changes as the number of processors used is 
increased:

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E(N,P) = \frac{S(N,P)}{P} = \frac{T(N,1)}{P T(N,P)}.)

Given that, in general, *S*(*N*, *P*) < *P*, it follows that *E*(*N*, *P*) < 1.

Finally, it can be useful to estimate the efficiency of the parts of your code 
that run only in parallel. The serial efficiency *E*(*N*) is measured by:

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E(N) = \frac{T_{best}(N)}{T(N,1)}.)

## Strong vs. weak scaling

Scaling describes how the runtime of a parallel application changes as the 
number of processors is increased. Usually, there are two types of scaling of 
interest:
- **strong scaling** is obtained by increasing the number of processors *P* 
used for a problem of fixed size/complexity *N*. As the number of processors 
increases, the amount of work per processor should decrease.
- **weak scaling** is obtained by increasing both the number of processors 
*and* the system size/complexity, with both of these being increased at the 
same rate.

Ideally, for strong scaling, the runtime will keep decreasing in direct 
proportion to the growing number of processors used. For weak scaling, the 
ideal situation is for the runtime to remain constant as the system size, and 
number of processors used, are increased. In general, good strong scaling is 
more relevant for most scientific problems, but is also more difficult to 
achieve than weak scaling.

### Amdhal's law and strong scaling

The limitations of strong scaling are best illustrated by Amdhal's law: "The 
performance improvement to be gained by parallelisation is limited by the 
proportion of the code which is serial". As more processors are used, the 
runtime becomes more and more dominated by the serial portion of a code.

### Gustafson's law and weak scaling

Gustafson's law provides a solution to the limitations of strong scaling 
described. The proposal is simply: we should run larger jobs on larger 
processor counts. If we run larger problems, then the parallelisable part of 
the problem will increase. We are still limited by the serial part of the 
code, but this becomes less important, and we can run on more processors more 
efficiently.

## Load imbalance

So far, we've only considered systems where all processors are equally busy.
