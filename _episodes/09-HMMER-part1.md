title: "PRACTICAL: HMMER (1 of 2)"
teaching: 10
exercises: 25
questions:
- "How does genomic sequence alignment software run in parallel using HPC?"
objectives:
- "Gain experience compiling software on an HPC machine, and running jobs in parallel"
- "Understand how a concrete software application divides up work, and what implications this has for parallel performance"
- "Measure how efficiently a software application uses many cores"
keypoints:
- "To run an application in parallel we should understand how it uses threads and/or MPI and how the scheduler and parallel application launcher interact"
- "Looking at parallel performance can tell us the most efficient way to run software to get a fast answer"
