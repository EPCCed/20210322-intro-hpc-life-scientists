## HPC in the EU and UK

HPC facilities are divided into tiers, with larger HPC systems being 
cateforised in higher tiers. In the UK, there are 3 tiers of supercompters:
- Tier 3 facilities are university supercomputers, and are aimed at helping
  researchers within given institutions only.
- Tier 2 facilities are a bit harder to define. Traditionally, they are 
  regional facilities, but this is less and less the case.
  - These are here to   fill the gap between the university Tier 3 systems and 
    the national Tier 1 systems. 
  - They can be highly specialised (*e.g.* [JADE](https://www.jade.ac.uk/) is 
    a GPU-only machine specifically targeting machine learning research 
    (though other research can also be done on it).
- Tier 1 facilities are nationally-leading centres (like ARCHER2). There is 
  usually one or two per country.
- Tier 0 systems are petaflop systems, and the best across a continent. PRACE
  provides access to [7 Tier 0 systems](https://prace-ri.eu/hpc-access/hpc-systems/).
  - Newer EU machines being delivered under [EuroHPC Joint Undertaking](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/)
