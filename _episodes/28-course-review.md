## Review of the course

The primary aim of this course was to teach you the basics of high-performance 
computing, and give a broad overview of how it can be be used for life science 
research. We hope that, during this course, we have answered the following 
questions:

- What is high-performance computing (HPC)?
- Why do people use HPC?
- What are the software and hardware components that make up a HPC (and a 
computer)?
  - How can these components affect the performance of applications?
- How do applications tackle problems in parallel?

Throughout this course, you will have had access to ARCHER2. We have aimed to 
provide you with a hands-on approach to using HPC facilities, and that you 
will now have a better idea of how to get the most out of the resources at 
your disposal. In particular, we hope that this course has given you:

- more experience of using a HPC machine and dealing with common stumbling 
blocks;
- a better notion of how to evaluate the parallel performance of an 
applications, and that you now know how to check that you are making good use 
of your HPC resources;
- Given you an understanding of current (and near-future) HPC facilities;
- an appreciation of the challenges of running life-science pipelines and 
workflows on HPC systems.
- Shown you how HPC can benefit your research, and where you can get access to 
HPC facilities in the EU and UK.


## Where next?

This course was run in a collaboration between [BioExcel](https://bioexcel.eu/), 
[EPCC](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/), and [PRACE](https://prace-ri.eu/). Each of 
these partners has a great track-record at providing a variety of courses, 
from introductory courses like this one to much more expert courses.

BioExcel focuses primarily on the use of HPC for life sciences. They offer 
a number [webinars](https://bioexcel.eu/category/webinar/) and 
[courses](https://bioexcel.eu/services/training/) -- most of these are 
recorded and free to watch after the fact. In particular, they run a [Summer 
School](https://bioexcel.eu/events/summer-school-on-biomolecular-simulations/) 
that focuses on providing a hands-on experience of using BioExcel flagship 
software and tools (such as GROMACS, CP2K, HADDOCK, *etc.*).

Through ARCHER2, EPCC provides a wide range of 
[courses and webinars](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/#upcoming-training) 
that cover a wide variety of topics that all relate to HPC. These range from 
introductory courses about using HPC facilities and certain highly-used 
ARCHER2 software (*e.g.* LAMMPS and CP2K), to courses about programming for 
HPC environments. All of these courses and webinars are free to the public, 
and the recordings of these courses are always available to watch after the 
fact (you can find past 
[EPCC courses here](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/materials/). EPCC also 
runs an 
[M.Sc. programme ](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/msc/programmes/msc-programmes).

PRACE predominantly focus on HPC and programming for HPC. PRACE offers a 
fantastic [Summer of HPC programme](https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/) that 
provides a one week training course to M.Sc. and B.Sc. students, followed by 
a 2-month placement at a European HPC centre. They also provide a number of 
[short tutorial videos](https://training.prace-ri.eu/index.php/prace-tutorials/) 
to teach the fundamentals of of working with parallel programming. Finally, 
they also run a number of [courses](https://events.prace-ri.eu/) related to 
HPC, many of which are available online afterwards.

Finally, for this course, you will have made ARCHER2 accounts -- these 
accounts will remain in place, and the budget code `ta017` will be available 
until **24th April 2021**. Please make use of this to test your systems on 
ARCHER2 and to get a better grasp of using state-of-the-art HPC facilities.

## Open consultation session

For the remainder of this course, the course organisers will be happy to 
answer any questions you have about your specific HPC need and uses. We're 
also happy to clarify any points and answer any questions about the course.
